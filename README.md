This is my code for the "Try it youself" part for the book of Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition, but I am a newbie

Python is new to me, so I am trying to learn Python with Python Crash Course(2nd Edition), I found this book is great for who wants to Python basics.
In each chapter there are exercises called "TRY IT YOURSELF", I am thinking maybe someone else would like to compare his/her code with the others, so here are my code.
I am a totally newbie so please forgive me for my low quality of code.
